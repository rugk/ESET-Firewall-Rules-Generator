# ESET-Firewall-Rules-Generator
This is a small tool for [ESET Smart Security] (https://forum.eset.com/forum/23-eset-smart-security/) which allows an easy creation of a firewall rules with many IPs.

## How to build
You need to download the following components. It only works on Windows.
* [AutoIt] (https://www.autoitscript.com) v 3.3.12.0
* [SciTE4AutoIt3] (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit-script-editor/downloads/) or (just) AutoItWrapper v 15.503.1200.2 (updated 5/4/2015)

If you are unsure which version to download just download the newest version.
Even if I did not listed the newest version here it may work with the newest one.
I'm always trying to use the latest version of AutoIt.

Then go on:

1. Download and install the stuff.

2. Open the script (the .au3) in SciTe.

3. Click on "*Tools*" -> "*Build*" or press F7. If you want to change the compilation options you can use "*Tools*" ->
"*Compile*" or press Ctrl+F7.
