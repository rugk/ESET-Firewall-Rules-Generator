# Contributing

If you want to create a pull request please follow the following guide:
1. Use Tidy which is included in SciTEAutoIt3 to tidy up your source code. Disable the option *region_indent* to prevent the regions
to be intended. Otherwise the default options are suitable.
2. Test your source. Test using the script in compiled and not compiled form.
3. Try to follow the [Best coding practices of AutoIt] (https://www.autoitscript.com/wiki/Best_coding_practices) (especially the "Names of Variables" part).
If you want to clean up some variables which do not fit to this scheme (I'm sure there are some...) feel free to create a pull request.
